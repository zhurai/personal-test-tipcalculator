Unity Project
v. 1.0

=========================

This is mainly a test for myself of how to use NGUI+Android Export.
This is also to set up a workflow in general for Unity for myself.
(Obviously this requires NGUI, Unity3d free, really...)

=========================

To use this you can open the project in Unity, and then import NGUI, and it should work (at least it did for me).
